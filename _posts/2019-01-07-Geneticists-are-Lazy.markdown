One of the most profound stories that stuck with me through undergrad into my PhD was "The Salvation of Doug" by William T. Sullivan. It follows an unnamed geneticist and his pal Doug, a biochemist, on their quest to determine how a car factory functions. While Doug sets off grinding (literally and figuratively!) away to figure out what cars are made of and how to put them back together, the geneticist ties the hand of a worker and goes about his day, waiting to see the end result.
